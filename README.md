Transform your YouTube experience with custom video controls, flipping, and looping features.

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 Custom loop controls (Premium)

## 🔧 Mocking YouTube Search (Local Dev)

To run the app without a working YouTube API key or allowed referer, enable mock search results:

1. Create `.env.local` in the project root with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SEARCH=true
```

2. Restart `npm run dev`.

When `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_SEARCH=true`, the search page returns fake results and still exercises daily search counting and gating. Set to `false` (or omit) to use the real YouTube API.
